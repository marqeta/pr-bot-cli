`Name`: marqeta/pr-bot-cli@main

PR Bot Cli is a GitHub Action that automatically approves PRs when user-defined reuqirements are met. If `auto-merge` is enabled at repository level, PRs could get auto merged as well.

## How to Use in GitHub Workflow. 
GitHub Workflow is a user-configurable automated process to run CI/CD jobs. 

It is very easy to use PR Bot Cli in [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/about-workflows). 

### 1. Create Presonal Access Token
To use PR Bot Cli, you would first need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token.

Click on your profile picture at top right corner, go to `settings` -> `developer settings` -> `personal access token` -> `fine-grained tokens`, click on the `generate new token`.

Remmeber to copy your personal access token as you woould need to use in the next step.
### 2. Store Personal Access Token as Repository Secret
Go to your repository, click on `settings`.

Go to `Secrets and variables` -> `actions` -> `New Repository Secrets`. Create a new secret paste your newly created GitHub token as its value, and set its name to `PR_BOT_TOKEN`.

### 3. Invoke GitHub Action
Create a `.github/prbot.yml` under root directory of your repository. 
```
name: PR Bot auto approval

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  pr-bot:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: PR Bot Auto Approval
        uses: marqeta/pr-bot-cli@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.PR_BOT_TOKEN }}
```

### 4. Create your own policy
Create a `.prbot/my_policy/approval.rego` and a `.prbot/my_policy/filter.rego` under root directorty of your repository.

In `filter.rego`, you could filter out the PRs that you would like PR Bot to review.

In `approval.rego`, you could specify the condition that PR Bot use to review / approve a PR.

You could find exmaples of PR Bot rego files at [here](https://github.com/marqeta/dependabot-demo/tree/main/.prbot)
